# MAG-CHAMBER
MAG-CHAMBER is a bullet-hell action game where you need to jump around the level to avoid enemies. Once you jump, time will slow down, giving you a moment to react to the chaos around you. Try to stay alive for as long as possible to beat your high-score!

## How to Play
Once you enter the main menu, you can access the options by clicking the top-left icon and you can quit the game by clicking the top-right icon. Clicking the game scene will start the game.

Point and click to jump towards a direction. While you are jumping, time will slow down. You can click somewhere else to redirect your jump, which will stop the slo-mo effect. Once you collide with a platform, you can jump again.

During gameplay, enemies will spawn around the border of the level. A good strategy would be to stay away from the level borders, as enemies could spawn and kill you without warning. You have no health in this game, one hit and it's game over!

Once you die your score will be saved and you will be brought back to the main menu where you can decide to quit or play again.
